Ricetron is a DeFi staking platform on TRON blockchain designed for minting RET (RICE ECONOMY TOKEN) token, a governance token for Rice Stable coin. Created spesifically to strenghen Indonesian food security.

## SOLUTIONS

Rice backed token (RIC) will be created to ensure the rice distribution, access and availability, and last but not least help reducing/erasing BULOG US$ 20 million loss each year. For start, we create RIC with premium rice as asset backing, and if it works we can create another version of RIC (let says RIC2) for medium grade rice.
1 RIC is equal to 1 kg premium rice (it can be Cianjur or Nganjuk grade rice). 

It will be backed by paid purchase order issued by BULOG and insured by State Owned General Insurance Company.

The total supply of RIC is infinite, when RIC is exchanged to Rice, the token will be burnt, while the paid P.O (voucher) is issued, RIC will be minted.

RIC token will be audited monthly and the audit result will be published on our website.

RIC token can be saved and loaned in RET DeFi that will be created, people can earn interest from RIC saving. 


- RET Crowdfunding

RET (Rice Economy Token) token will be created as governance token, the token holder of RET will entitled to 30% revenues stream of RET DeFi, such as 30% of transaction fee out of 0,35% charged per transaction in RET DEFI, 30 % fee out of tx fee in all RIC transaction out of 0,35%, reduction of interest rates loan by 20%, all will be distributed as half yearly dividend derived from all DeFi and RIC transaction.

RET also also function as crowdfunding token, all RET distribution will finance RIC minting.

Only 269.000 RET will be minted in total.

All revenues stream for RET holders will be calculated & distributed automatically every 6 months by smart contract directly to separate wallet which will be distributed to all holder in TRON WALLET such as TRONLINK after wallet snapshot date (comparable to cum dividend in stock market).

- RET STAKING

Nowadays, crypto community does not trust ICO anymore, they prefer staking as the new token can be swap directly to native coin as soon as possible, and developer can get instant capital from unstaking fee which can be used to develop their program.
